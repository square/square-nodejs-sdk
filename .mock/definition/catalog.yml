        Deletes a set of [CatalogItem](entity:CatalogItem)s based on the

        provided list of target IDs and returns a set of successfully deleted
        IDs in

        the response. Deletion is a cascading event such that all children of
        the

        targeted object are also deleted. For example, deleting a CatalogItem
        will

        also delete all of its
        [CatalogItemVariation](entity:CatalogItemVariation)

        children.


        `BatchDeleteCatalogObjects` succeeds even if only a portion of the
        targeted

        IDs can be deleted. The response will only include IDs that were

        actually deleted.


        To ensure consistency, only one delete request is processed at a time
        per seller account.

        While one (batch or non-batch) delete request is being processed, other
        (batched and non-batched)

        delete requests are rejected with the `429` error code.

                A batch of CatalogObjects to be inserted/updated atomically.

                The objects within a batch will be inserted in an all-or-nothing
                fashion, i.e., if an error occurs

                attempting to insert or update an object within a batch, the
                entire batch will be rejected. However, an error

                in one batch will not affect other batches within the same
                request.


                For each object, its `updated_at` field is ignored and replaced
                with a current
                [timestamp](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-dates),
                and its

                `is_deleted` field must not be set to `true`.


                To modify an existing object, supply its ID. To create a new
                object, use an ID starting

                with `#`. These IDs may be used to create relationships between
                an object and attributes of

                other objects that reference it. For example, you can create a
                CatalogItem with

                ID `#ABC` and a CatalogItemVariation with its `item_id`
                attribute set to

                `#ABC` in order to associate the CatalogItemVariation with its
                parent

                CatalogItem.


                Any `#`-prefixed IDs are valid only within a single atomic
                batch, and will be replaced by server-generated IDs.


                Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects. The total number of
                objects across all batches for a single request

                may not exceed 10,000. If either of these limits is violated, an
                error will be returned and no objects will

                be inserted or updated.

              An optional case-insensitive, comma-separated list of object types
              to retrieve.


              The valid values are defined in the
              [CatalogObjectType](entity:CatalogObjectType) enum, for example,

              `ITEM`, `ITEM_VARIATION`, `CATEGORY`, `DISCOUNT`, `TAX`,

              `MODIFIER`, `MODIFIER_LIST`, `IMAGE`, etc.


              If this is unspecified, the operation returns objects of all the
              top level types at the version

              of the Square API used to make the request. Object types that are
              nested onto other object types

              are not included in the defaults.


              At the current API version the default object types are:

              ITEM, CATEGORY, TAX, DISCOUNT, MODIFIER_LIST, 

              PRICING_RULE, PRODUCT_SET, TIME_PERIOD, MEASUREMENT_UNIT,

        This (`SearchCatalogObjects`) endpoint differs from the
        [SearchCatalogItems](api-endpoint:Catalog-SearchCatalogItems)

        endpoint in the following aspects:


        - `SearchCatalogItems` can only search for items or item variations,
        whereas `SearchCatalogObjects` can search for any type of catalog
        objects.

        - `SearchCatalogItems` supports the custom attribute query filters to
        return items or item variations that contain custom attribute values,
        where `SearchCatalogObjects` does not.

        - `SearchCatalogItems` does not support the `include_deleted_objects`
        filter to search for deleted items or item variations, whereas
        `SearchCatalogObjects` does.

        - The both endpoints have different call conventions, including the
        query filter formats.

              docs: >-
                The desired set of object types to appear in the search results.


                If this is unspecified, the operation returns objects of all the
                top level types at the version

                of the Square API used to make the request. Object types that
                are nested onto other object types

                are not included in the defaults.


                At the current API version the default object types are:

                ITEM, CATEGORY, TAX, DISCOUNT, MODIFIER_LIST, 

                PRICING_RULE, PRODUCT_SET, TIME_PERIOD, MEASUREMENT_UNIT,

                SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN, ITEM_OPTION, CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTE_DEFINITION,
                QUICK_AMOUNT_SETTINGS.


                Note that if you wish for the query to return objects belonging
                to nested types (i.e., COMPONENT, IMAGE,

                ITEM_OPTION_VAL, ITEM_VARIATION, or MODIFIER), you must
                explicitly include all the types of interest

                in this field.
            include_deleted_objects:

                If `true`, deleted objects will be included in the results.
                Defaults to `false`. Deleted objects will have their
                `is_deleted` field set to `true`. If `include_deleted_objects`
                is `true`, then the `include_category_path_to_root` request
                parameter must be `false`. Both properties cannot be `true` at
                the same time.
            include_related_objects:

                If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are
                related to the

                requested objects. Related objects are objects that are
                referenced by object ID by the objects

                in the response. This is helpful if the objects are being
                fetched for immediate display to a user.

                This process only goes one level deep. Objects referenced by the
                related objects will not be included.

                For example:


                If the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItem,
                its associated

                CatalogCategory objects, CatalogTax objects, CatalogImage
                objects and

                CatalogModifierLists will be returned in the `related_objects`
                field of the

                response. If the `objects` field of the response contains a
                CatalogItemVariation,

                its parent CatalogItem will be returned in the `related_objects`
                field of

                the response.

                exclusive - objects with a

                supplied limit is negative, zero, or

                is higher than the maximum limit of 1,000, it will be ignored.

                returned category is a top-level category, the `path_to_root`
                list is empty and is not returned in the response payload. If

        Searches for catalog items or item variations by matching supported
        search attribute values, including

        custom attribute values, against one or more of the specified query
        filters.


        This (`SearchCatalogItems`) endpoint differs from the
        [SearchCatalogObjects](api-endpoint:Catalog-SearchCatalogObjects)

        endpoint in the following aspects:


        - `SearchCatalogItems` can only search for items or item variations,
        whereas `SearchCatalogObjects` can search for any type of catalog
        objects.

        - `SearchCatalogItems` supports the custom attribute query filters to
        return items or item variations that contain custom attribute values,
        where `SearchCatalogObjects` does not.

        - `SearchCatalogItems` does not support the `include_deleted_objects`
        filter to search for deleted items or item variations, whereas
        `SearchCatalogObjects` does.

        - The both endpoints use different call conventions, including the query
        filter formats.
