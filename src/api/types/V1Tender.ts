/**
 * A tender represents a discrete monetary exchange. Square represents this
 * exchange as a money object with a specific currency and amount, where the
 * amount is given in the smallest denomination of the given currency.
 *
 * Square POS can accept more than one form of tender for a single payment (such
 * as by splitting a bill between a credit card and a gift card). The `tender`
 * field of the Payment object lists all forms of tender used for the payment.
 *
 * Split tender payments behave slightly differently from single tender payments:
 *
 * The receipt_url for a split tender corresponds only to the first tender listed
 * in the tender field. To get the receipt URLs for the remaining tenders, use
 * the receipt_url fields of the corresponding Tender objects.
 *
 * *A note on gift cards**: when a customer purchases a Square gift card from a
 * merchant, the merchant receives the full amount of the gift card in the
 * associated payment.
 *
 * When that gift card is used as a tender, the balance of the gift card is
 * reduced and the merchant receives no funds. A `Tender` object with a type of
 * `SQUARE_GIFT_CARD` indicates a gift card was used for some or all of the
 * associated payment.
