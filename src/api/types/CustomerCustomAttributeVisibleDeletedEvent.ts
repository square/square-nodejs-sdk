 * Published when a customer [custom attribute](entity:CustomAttribute) that is visible to the
 * subscribing application is deleted. A notification is sent when:
 * - Your application deletes a custom attribute owned by your application, regardless of the `visibility` setting.
 * - Any application deletes a custom attribute whose `visibility` is `VISIBILITY_READ_ONLY`
 * or `VISIBILITY_READ_WRITE_VALUES`.
 *
 * Custom attributes set to `VISIBILITY_READ_WRITE_VALUES` can be deleted by any application, but those set to
 * `VISIBILITY_READ_ONLY` or `VISIBILITY_HIDDEN` can only be deleted by the owner. Custom attributes are owned
 * by the application that created the corresponding [custom attribute definition](entity:CustomAttributeDefinition).
