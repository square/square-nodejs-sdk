 * Published when a location [custom attribute](entity:CustomAttribute) that is visible
 * to the subscribing application is created or updated. A notification is sent when:
 * - Your application creates or updates a custom attribute owned by your application, regardless of the `visibility` setting.
 * - Any application creates or updates a custom attribute whose `visibility` is `VISIBILITY_READ_ONLY`
 * or `VISIBILITY_READ_WRITE_VALUES`.
 *
 * Custom attributes set to `VISIBILITY_READ_WRITE_VALUES` can be created or updated by any application, but those set to
 * `VISIBILITY_READ_ONLY` or `VISIBILITY_HIDDEN` can only be created or updated by the owner. Custom attributes are owned
 * by the application that created the corresponding [custom attribute definition](entity:CustomAttributeDefinition).
